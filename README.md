# Learn You a Haskell Exercises

Some exercises as a companion for the book Learn You a Haskell For Great Good!

See [http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)

The exercises were taken from [noelmarkham/learn-you-a-haskell-exercises](https://github.com/noelmarkham/learn-you-a-haskell-exercises) and I have attempted to turn them into a `stack` project with unit tests.

I'll welcome any PRs for additional or improved exercises and tests :)

## Testing

All exercises should have associated `hspec` tests, and you can run all the tests through `stack` by running: `stack test`.
